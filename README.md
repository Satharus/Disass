## About 
Disass (Short for disassemble) is an interface for the GNU Debugger (GDB).

It's mainly made for disassembly in mind, but if you found it comfortable to use for normal debugging purposes then go ahead!

[Here is a GIF of all of the progress throughout the versions so far.](https://github.com/Satharus/Disass/blob/master/Screenshots/Progress.gif)

## How to use
- Make sure you have gdb installed.

    ```$ gdb --version```
    - If not, then install it using the following command depending on your distro of choice:
   ##### Arch and its Derivatives(Manjaro, Antergos, etc..)
      # pacman -S gdb
   ##### Debian and its Derivatives(Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc..)
      # apt update && apt install gdb
   ##### RedHat and its Family(CentOS, Fedora, etc..)
      # yum install gdb
- Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Satharus/Disass/releases) page.
- Download the [version](https://github.com/Satharus/Disass/tree/master/Screenshots) you want of Disass.
- Mark the AppImage as executable or run ```chmod +x Disass-vY-x86_64.AppImage```
- Double click the AppImage or run ```./Disass-vY-x86_64.AppImage```

**Note:** replace ```Y``` with the version you downloaded.
